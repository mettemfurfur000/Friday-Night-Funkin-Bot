For independent assignment of positions arrows, it is better to make a 
screenshot of the game, and further operations to perform in the standard 
Windows photo viewer. 

Take a screenshot, open it in a separate folder, and when you're ready, press the "End" key.

If you do not want to start configuration mode, press the "Delete" key.
