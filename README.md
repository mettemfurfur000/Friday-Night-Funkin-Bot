# Friday-Night-Funkin-Bot
It's a bot that automatically plays FnF. If you want to change the position of the arrows or their color, you can adjust this behavior yourself via edit mode!
# Installation
I don't know, everything you need is already in the release. Download and try it!
# First start
I used the bot myself for a while and tested it on AntipathyPsych mod at 1360x768 resolution in the window, but for other mods or the original will have to reconfigure a little :)
# Use
Download, unzip anywhere (possibly on the desktop), run the .exe file, run FnF (possibly with mods), press 'Insert' and watch.

# Issues
There's a detail. Try to turn off screen shake and make sure that the arrows do not move on the screen. The plan is to do recognition on neural networks, but I don't think I'll ever get around to it :P

What is this crap on my screen when I turn on the bot? and during editing as well? This is how I check if the application is reading the mouse positions correctly and if the arrow positions are defined correctly. You can disable this by deleting the "debug.bin" file.
